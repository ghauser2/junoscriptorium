<description>
For the EX platform, the check-vcp-ports feature allows for automatically disable (and re-enable) one or more interfaces by checking the operational status of one or more VC ports. If none of the listed VC ports is operational, a configured list of interfaces is disabled. As soon as at least one of the listed VC ports becomes available, the interfaces are enabled again.

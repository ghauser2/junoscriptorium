This op script is similar to op-ping-rtt.slax but without using jcs:syslog(),
which is available in JUNOS 9.0 and later. Note this script is used in
conjunction with the event script display_rtt_detail.slax, which runs for
every hour and read the same accounting profile file and get the last 1 hour
data and write to console. Eventd will capture the data written to console
and will write into file and upload to a configured destination.

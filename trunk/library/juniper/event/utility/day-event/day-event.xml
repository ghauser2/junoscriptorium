         This script logs a message to the syslog every day in the following format:
         
         Oct 30 00:00:00  j4350 cscript: Day-Event: Fri Oct 30 00:00
         
         With this in place, other event polices can now trigger based on the current day.  For example, if a policy
         should run every friday then the following match conditions should be used:
         
         policy friday-policy {
             events system;
             attributes-match {
                 system.message matches "Day-Event: Fri";
             }
             then {
                 ...
             }
         }
         
         By default, the message is logged every day at 00:00.  If a different time is desired then configured one of
         the following generate events with the needed time-of-day: day-event-time-1, day-event-time-2, day-event-time-3,
         day-event-time-4, or day-event-time-5:
         
         generate-event {
             day-event-time-2 time-of-day "02:00:00";
         }
         

         To use, copy the day-event.slax script into your /var/db/scripts directory and then enable it using the following
         command:
         set event-options event-script file day-event.slax
         
         Restrictions & Misc
         -------------------
         Only the UTC time-zone is supported due to PR 459078.

         If you ever manually change your system time, then you need to do a "commit full" or "restart event-process" or 
         "request system scripts event-scripts reload" because your time-of-day events will be off time.

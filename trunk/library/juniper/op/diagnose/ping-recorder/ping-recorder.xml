<description>
    This script performs pings to a configured set of hosts and
    records the results of the ping in an accounting profile file.
    The function of this script is controlled by two apply-macros.
    The "control" macro controls the operation of the script, and the
    "targets" macro lists the hostname or ip address which the script
    should ping.  The control macro lists the output file, which must
    be a configured accounting profile file, as well as the layout name
    and the number of pings per attempt.

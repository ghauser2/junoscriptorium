  <description>
  This script provides a quick and dirty way to upgrade both routing-engines
  with a single command.  Note that there is no attempt at ISSU or graceful
  switchover between routing-engines.  This is only intended for lab use or
  when initially deploying routers, not during production.
  
  The usage is simple, at a minimum specify the file parameter with the filename.
  If the force or validate upgrade knobs are desired then those should be specified
  on the command-line as well, otherwise they default to their default value.

Overview

Commit Script Builder is an op script that allows users to create their own customized commit scripts 
without requiring any scripting knowledge.  There is a large percentage of Junos users that will never 
learn how to write their own scripts.  Providing tools such as this gives them the next best thing 
because it allows them to still take advantage of Junos automation without requiring that they master 
scripting.

Commit Script Builder works by allowing the user to select among various pre-defined configuration 
violations.  They select which violations they want to monitor and then select what action should be 
performed if the violation occurs.  After the desired logic has been assembled Commit Script Builder 
can generate a commit script - customized according to their settings - and enable it on their local 
Junos device.

Example

The following outputs provide an example of how Commit Script Builder can be used to create a 
customized commit script.  The script can be run in two ways:

    * Loaded and enabled as an op script
    * Executed remotely via op url

Utilizing the op url to advantageous because it means you can install your customized commit script 
without even loading/enabling a single script on your device.

Welcome to Commit Script Builder 1.0!
---------------------------------
This script gives you easy control over the commit process of your Junos
device.  Select what configuration violations should be checked, and what
actions should be performed if they occur.  Then allow the Commit Script
Builder op script to generate the customized commit script, save it within
the local commit script directory, and enable it automatically.

The main menu provides a number of different options, the one we are interested in now is 'Edit 
Configuration Violations' because we want to select violations to monitor.

[Configuration Violation Categories]
------------------------------------
1. Access            11. RADIUS
2. Authentication    12. RSVP
3. BGP               13. Routing

5. Hierarchies       15. Security
6. IS-IS             16. System

0. Return to Main Menu
------------------------------------
(0 selected violations)
Select Category:> 6

Next, we can select from the different violation categories that have been created.  Categories 
are similar to tags in that each violation falls within more than one.  We'll select IS-IS and 
continue on.

[IS-IS - Configuration Violations]
----------------------------------
1. Interface enabled for IS-IS protocol lacks family iso
2. lo0.0 interface doesn't have an ISO address
3. lo0.0 interface is not included in IS-IS
...
0. Return to Category Menu
----------------------------------
[#] = Action is selected
Select Violation to Edit:> 1

As you can see, there are currently three IS-IS violations that can be selected.  We'll choose 
#1.

[Edit Configuration Violation Response]

|Synopsis: Interface enabled for IS-IS protocol lacks family iso             |
|............................................................................|
|The interface has been specifically configured under [edit protocols isis]  |
|but it lacks family iso in its interface configuration.  (Interfaces that   |
|are enabled through 'interface all' are not considered, also fxp0.0 and     |
|lo0.0 are ignored).  If Auto-Correct is selected then family iso is added   |
|automatically to the interface.                                             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1. Error - Fail commit with an error message
2. Warning - Display warning message on console
3. Syslog - Write warning message to syslog
4. Warning & Syslog - Report warning to both console and syslog
5. Auto-Correct - Add family iso to interface
[6] Do nothing - Do not monitor this violation

[#] = Current Selection
Select Response:> 5


This next menu provides more details on the violation and provides a number of options.  The
selected option is shown by enclosing it within [ ], and as you can see we are currently 
ignoring this configuration violation.  We'll select option 5 so that the commit script will 
automatically add family iso to the interface for us.

Following this selection we return back to the violation menu.  We'll skip that output and 
press '0' until we return to the main menu.

This time we selected option 2, which shows us the if/then logic of our commit script.  The 
final step is to build and apply the commit script by selecting option 4.  Here are the

The process was successfuly, and as you can see the J4350 is now the proud owner of a customized 
commit script.  Should we decide to modify our current selections then we can rerun the Commit 
Script Builder op script and it will automatically read our past selections from the 
custom-commit-script.slax file:

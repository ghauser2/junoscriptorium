  <description>
Many security policy lists have a blanket reject/deny term as their
last term, so that if nothing matches the previous terms, it's not
allowed.  But if a user adds a new term, the new term is inserted
by default at the end of the list of terms, preventing it from
doing its job.

This script moves such a term to the proper position as the last term.

Note that this script will not work with config groups, since they
are always the last terms.

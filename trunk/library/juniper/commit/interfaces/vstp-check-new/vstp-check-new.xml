<description>
This commit-script ensures that any trunked VLANs (on "xe-*" interfaces in this case) are configured for VSTP and have a bridge-domain associated with it. This script errors if the VLAN is not in VSTP
 or in a bridge-domain and warns if the VLAN is in VSTP, but does not have a priority associated with it.

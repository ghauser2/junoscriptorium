This script alters the behavior of the interface-range configuration statement.  Rather than remaining as a 
permanent part of the configuration, it is treated as a temporary instruction to the commit process to copy 
all its enclosed configuration statements to its member interfaces.  After copying the indicated configuration, 
the interface-range statement is removed from the configuration, leaving only the altered interface 
configurations.
 
Example:
interface-range example {
   member ge-4/*/0;
   flexible-vlan-tagging;
}

After commit becomes:
ge-4/0/0 {
    flexible-vlan-tagging;
}
ge-4/1/0 {
    flexible-vlan-tagging;
}

Member interfaces are determined based on the installed interfaces within the chassis as well as uninstalled 
interfaces that appear within the configuration.  In the above example, both ge-4/0/0 and ge-4/1/0 exist within
the router but ge-4/2/0 and ge-4/3/0 do not.  (Which is why the expanded configuration does not include them).

Interface ranges that do not have any configuration other than member or member-range statements will be ignored.
Also, any interface-ranges with apply-macro do-not-expand configured will be ignored:

Example ignored ranges:
interface-range ignored1 {
    member-range ge-1/0/0 to ge-2/0/0;
}
interface-range ignored2 {
    member ge-5/0/*;
    apply-macro do-not-expand;
    mtu 9192;
}

Multiple-routing-engine Guidelines:

* "system commit synchronize" must be enabled
* Always perform commits from the Master routing-engine or interface-ranges will not expand correctly

Installation Instructions:
1. Copy script to commit script directory of all routing-engines in the chassis
     A. /var/db/scripts/commit for most Junos devices
     B. /config/db/scripts/commit for EX Series
2. Verify that "system commit synchronize" is enabled on multiple-routing-engine systems
3. Configure "set system scripts commit file expand-interface-ranges.slax" and commit

Alternatively, an installation op script is available here:
http://junoscriptorium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/library/juniper/op/installation/install-expand-interface-ranges/install-expand-interface-ranges.xml

It can be installed locally and run as a normal op script, or for convenience, can be run from a remote
location via the "op url" cli command.  Junos devices with an active Internet connection can install the
expand-interface-ranges script by running a single CLI command:
op url http://junoscriptorium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/library/juniper/op/installation/install-expand-interface-ranges/install-expand-interface-ranges.slax

Minimum JUNOS Version: 10.0
Latest Script Version: 1.2

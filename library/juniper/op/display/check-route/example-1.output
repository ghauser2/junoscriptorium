This script would do following:
1)	Go over all zones 
2)	Check over which route table this zone will resolve routes
3)	For each address entry it will check whether route exists in the right routing table

user@router> op check-route    
ZONE "trust" RESOLVES OVER "inet.0"
ZONE "untrust" RESOLVES OVER "inet.0"
ZONE "vpn" RESOLVES OVER "inet.0"
ZONE "test" RESOLVES OVER "test.inet.0"
    ADDRESS ENTRY "test" WITH IP "98.99.98.98/32" ZONE "test" CANNOT BE RESOLVED!

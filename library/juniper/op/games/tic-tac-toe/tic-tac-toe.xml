Play a quick game of tic-tac-toe on your Junos device against a human or computer opponent.

Human vs Human Games
--------------------
Each player has a separate connection to the Junos device (the same user account can be
used by both).  The first player starts the game and selects to act as the game server.
The second player then joins the game.

Human vs Computer Games
-----------------------
There are three levels of difficulty with "Unbeatable" being literally unbeatable.  (The
best you can hope for is to tie).

Play it Remotely
----------------
In Junos 10.0 and above the game can be played without installing it first by using the following
command:

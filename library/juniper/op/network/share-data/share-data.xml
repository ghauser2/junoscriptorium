/*
 * This script maintains common config groups among a set of routers.
 * Each group to be shared contains a list of targets to which the
 * contents of the group a copied.  The contents of this group on
 * remote machines are completely replaced by the incoming data.
 *
 * The script detects which addresses are assigned to the local device
 * and will skip such addresses, so the local device can be listed among
 * the targets, allowing the config to be updated and shared from any
 * device on the list.
 *
 * The share-data script can be invoked in two ways.  With no
 * arguments, the script looks for any group containing an
 * apply-macro named "share-data".  The contents of the macro are
 * a list of targets to which the shared data should be copied.
 *
 * In addition, the share-data script can be invoked with a set of
 * command line arguments to detail the exact data (by config group
 * using the "group" parameter) and targets to which that data should
 * be copied (using the "target" parameter with a space-separated
 * list of targets).
 *
 * The "database" argument can tell the script to use the "candidate"
 * configuration database, which allows uncommitted data to be shared.
 * The default behavior is to use the committed configuration.
 *
 * "transform":  Each target listed in the "share-data" macro can
 * contain (as its value (in the name/value pairing)) the name of
 * a func:function that can be called with the contents of the config
 * group to be shared, and returns the data to be shipped to that
 * target.  This allows all manner of transformations to be implemented
 * inside his framework.

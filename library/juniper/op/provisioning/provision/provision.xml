  <description>
This is an example script that demonstrates how to perform both local and remote provisioning.
It is designed to work in a specific topology and as such is not expected to be executed in other
networks; however, the code can be referenced if you wish to learn how to execute RPCs remotely 
as well as how to create a menu-based op script.

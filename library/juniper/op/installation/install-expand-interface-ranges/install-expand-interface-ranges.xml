    <![CDATA[
This script installs the expand-interface-ranges.slax script into the Junos device by writing the embedded
contents to the local routing-engine and copying it to all other routing-engines in the chassis.  It also
automatically enables the script within the configuration.

It can be run by copying it to the local Junos device's op script directory and enabling it in the configuration
as an op script, or preferably it can be run from a remote location by use of the "op url" command that was 
introduced in Junos 10.0
 
Restrictions:

* J/SRX chassis clusters are not supported and will not install correctly
* Multiple-routing-engine systems must have "system commit synchronize" configured

Minimum JUNOS Version: 10.0
Latest Script Version: 1.0

Interface Range Command Requirement: 

In the enterprise market, it is not uncommon to see group of ports
(20+, even 100+) to have the same attributes. Currently in JUNOS, 
there is no way to configure the same attributes across multiple ports.
Configuring ports one at a time is long and tedious process.

For example, if I want to assign VLAN "data" to ports ge-0/0/0 to
ge-0/0/20, ge-0/1/0 to ge-0/1/10, ge-0/1/15 set interfaces ge-0/0/0-20
ge-0/1/0-10 ge-0/1/15 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan member data

The range command should also be available for any stanza in JUNOS, i.e.
protocols, etherenet-switching-options, etc.
set class-of-service interfaces ge-0/0/12-15 ge-0/0/20 ge-0/5/40-47

Usage:

This Op script is used to expand the interface port range

For example

 set interfaces ge-0/0/0-20 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members data

 gets expanded into multiple set command like

 set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members data
 set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members data
 ....
 ....
 set interfaces ge-0/0/19 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members data
 set interfaces ge-0/0/20 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members data

How to run:

 userid@machine-name> op expand-interface-port-range command 
 "set interfaces ge-0/0/0-20 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members data" |
 save /var/tmp/out

 userid@machine# load set /var/tmp/out

 Expects the interface format as "intprefix-fpc/pic/startport-endport" and
 only one range can be given per command, for multiple range please execute 
 this script multiple times.

 Use case: Can be used to configure the same attribute in multiple ports.
 This op-script will expand the set command and user can save the output
 of this command and execute "load set" to configure the interface.

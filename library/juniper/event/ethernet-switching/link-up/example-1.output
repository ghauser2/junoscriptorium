You invoke it by adding the following to the switch's configuration:

event-options {
    policy LINK-UP {
        events snmp_trap_link_up;
        then {
            event-script link-up.slax {
                arguments {
                    ifname "{$$.interface-name}";
                }
            }
       }
    }
}


The output is SYSLOG will look like:

Aug  1 16:14:37   cscript: link-up.slax: IFNAME ge-0/0/3 MAC 00:1e:37:86:13:30


This was tested on EX4200 running JUNOS 9.6.

Note: To allow time for the ethernet switching table to populate, I had to add a delay once the event triggers.

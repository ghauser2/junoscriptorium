This script alters the behavior of the interface-range configuration statement.  Rather
than remaining as a permanent part of the configuration, it is treated as a temporary
instruction to the commit process to copy all its enclosed configuration statements
to its member interfaces.  After copying the indicated configuration, the interface-range
statement is removed from the configuration, leaving only the altered interface
configurations.
 
Example:
interface-range example {
   member ge-4/*/0;
   flexible-vlan-tagging;
}

After commit becomes:
ge-4/0/0 {
    flexible-vlan-tagging;
}
ge-4/1/0 {
    flexible-vlan-tagging;
}

Member interfaces are determined based on the installed interfaces within the chassis
as well as uninstalled interfaces that appear within the configuration.  In the above
example, both ge-4/0/0 and ge-4/1/0 exist within the router but ge-4/2/0 and ge-4/3/0
do not.  (Which is why the expanded configuration does not include them).

Interface ranges that do not have any configuration other than member or member-range
statements will be ignored.  Also, any interface-ranges with apply-macro do-not-expand
configured will be ignored:

Example ignored ranges:
interface-range ignored1 {
    member-range ge-1/0/0 to ge-2/0/0;
}
interface-range ignored2 {
    member ge-5/0/*;
    apply-macro do-not-expand;
    mtu 9192;
}

To enable, perform the following:

1. Copy script file to commit script directory of all routing-engines in the chassis
     A. /var/db/scripts/commit for most Junos devices
     B. /config/db/scripts/commit for EX Series
2. Verify that "system commit synchronize" is enabled on multiple-routing-engine systems
3. Configure "set system scripts commit file expand-interface-ranges.slax" and commit

Multi-routine-engine Guidelines:

* "system commit synchronize" must be enabled
* Always perform commits from the Master routing-engine or ranges will not expand
correctly.

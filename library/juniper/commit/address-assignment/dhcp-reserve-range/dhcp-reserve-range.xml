  <description>
Junos routers do not support a range to be excluded from the dynamic dhcp pool in addition static-bindings must be inside the dynamic range for a pool. This means you cannot reserve a section of the dhcp range to be used only for static-bindings. For example you may want 172.16.1.32-47 to be reserved for static bindings only and have dyanmic bindings start at 48.

This script mimicks the desired behavior by doing tranient change on commit that has fake static-bidings to "reserve" the range for future static-bindings. If a static-binding exists for an IP address in the range a fake binding is not created.

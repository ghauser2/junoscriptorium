<description>
Junos doesn't allow multiple network prefix lines under the same pool currently, but E-series/Junos allows SP to configure multiple pool range under the same pool name, which means SPs who use E-series/JUNOSe are familiar with sharing same pool name for multiple address ranges and developing & enghancing address provisioning system. Now, this script is addressing a pain-point of lack of pool name sharing for multiple v4/v6 network prefixes in Junos by doing auto pool name generation. And place each prefix under unique auto-generated pool name that is derived major pool name and all pools derived from same pool name will be linked from 1st to the the last. So, SP doesn't need to remember or track all pool name but only name of major/head pool will be needed to be remembered - it's quite simple and easy for radius side frame-pool provisioning.

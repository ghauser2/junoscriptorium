  <description>
    JUNOS firewall filters default to discarding anything
    that doesn't match the filter.  To achieve the opposite
    behavior, the filter must include a bare 'then accept'
    (with no match conditions).  Such configuration is difficult
    to maintain.  This script checks to ensure that every filter
    has a bare accept statement.  If one is missing, the script
    adds it and issues a warning to inform the user of the action.

  <implementation>
    If the last term in a filter has a "from" or "to", repair it
    and emit an &lt;xnm:warning&gt; for the user.

  <description>
    We need to make an lo0 filter based on our BGP config.  Any
    members of BGP groups with "apply-macro ttl-security" turned
    on are listed in the "ttl-security" filter and are only allowed
    if the TTL on incoming packets is 254, meaning they are exactly
    one hop away.

  <implementation>
    Three parts to this script.  First we set the TTL to 255.  Then
    we make a filter that discards traffic where TTL != 254.  Then
    we put that filter in lo0.
    
    We don't want to interfere with an existing filter on lo0, so
    we have to look at the current state.  If there's no filter,
    we make one and put a "then accept" on it.  If there's a single
    filter, we turn it into a filter list with our's at the front of
    the list.  If there's already a filter list, we add our's to the
    front of the list.
